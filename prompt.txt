You are helping tune hyperparameters to minimize loss .
The objective function of this task is a binary quadratic function.
x1 must be in range { search_space [-5，5]}. x2 must be in range {search_space [-5，5]}.
the data type is int.
I want you to recommend a configuration that can minimize the loss which need achieve 0;
You cannot provide the same data as the historical trial data below!
Here are your historical trial data which can help you select next point, formatted as [Hyperparameter configuration] - [loss]:
{"x": [0, 0]} - ["loss": 13]
Please do not provide parameters that have already been tried!
Do not put new lines or extra characters in your response ！
Please give you answer and format your output as follows : {"x": [x1, x2]}
