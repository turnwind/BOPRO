# BOPRO
BoPRO is a simple attempt at LLM for Bayesian Optimization. By generating meta-prompts to enhance the model's understanding of tasks, knowledge transfer and meta-learning are achieved.

## How to use
As you can see, it's very simple.

⚠️ **Note:** Due to issues with the formatting of LLM output, some functions may experience abnormalities. This will be addressed through the new feature (**response_format**) provided by OpenAI.
